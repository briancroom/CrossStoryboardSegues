CrossStoryboardSegues
=====================

A small set of UIStoryboardSegue subclasses allowing you to push or present a view controller from a different storyboard, all within the Storyboard Editor.

This is a slightly modified re-implementation of a concept presented by @adriankemp [here](http://adriankemp.com/2013/04/01/making-friends-with-interface-builder/). This version looks at properties on the destination view controller to determine which storyboard to jump to, and which view controller from that storyboard to instantiate.

TODO: Add better documentation here, screenshots, etc.
